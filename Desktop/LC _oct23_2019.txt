To build upon the question from the gallery, I beleive that if we are to add a councillor from an underrepresented and or minority group then we should add members from all of underrepresented and or minority groups in order  to remain fair. 
if we add a member of the indegenous affairs committee, what of the francophone student body, the BSN, MSA, or the countless other minority groups. 
Howevwer, adding all these members would obviously be unrealistic. and therefore I don't see how just adding one could be fair. I do understand the plight of the indigenous community, but as a minority group they should be the first to understand my point.
